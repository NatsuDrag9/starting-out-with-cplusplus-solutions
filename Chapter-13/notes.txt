Using chapter 6's directory structure as no classes are involved

Couldn't solve question 4

Unless I created a separate .txt file for each challenge, I used existing .txt files in the current directory to test most challenges.

For question 7, I added 1 instead of 10 to the ASCII code of each character read from the input file.

Skipped questions 12 and 13 as they were very similar to 10 and 11
