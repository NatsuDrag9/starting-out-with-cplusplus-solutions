Using chapter 6's directory structure as no classes are involved

Couldn't solve question 4

Used existing .txt files in the current directory to test most challenges. I did not create a separate .txt file for each challenge

For question 7, I added 1 instead of 10 to the ASCII code of each character read from the input file.
